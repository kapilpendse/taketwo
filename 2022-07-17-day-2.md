## "But this is very day 2…"

I’ve heard that one many times in the last couple of years. Heck, I’ve said it myself as well. As the business and the team supporting it has been growing every single day, processes and practices have started creeping in, that at times even got me wondering why are we following this mindlessly.

“Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.” -Jeff Bezos

Processes, as Jeff Bezos explained in his 2016 letter to shareholders [Jeff Bezos' 2016 Letter to Amazon Shareholders](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders), are susceptible to becoming proxies, which can take you away from your customers. When processes become proxies, there is a real danger of getting dragged into Day 2. He also wrote “Resist Proxies… …It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?”

I had read this letter before, but it wasn’t until a friend at work said something to me that a light bulb went off - he said Day 1 is not a state or a process. Day 1 is a mentality.

Processes - or more generally speaking programs, goals, KPIs and stuff like that - are just “things” created to serve a purpose, but when the sphere of influence is too big, these things can sometimes get built based on the least common denominator of vastly different scenarios. That in itself isn’t Day 2. That’s just an under-evolved, under-nuanced version of some new and probably important “thing”. Adopting that “thing” mindlessly even if it doesn’t make sense for one’s specific scenario - that is Day 2. So then what is Day 1, and how do you stay in Day 1?

Day 1 is Having Backbone to respectfully challenge the “thing” instead of mindlessly adopting it. Day 1 is taking Ownership of the situation and coming up with a constructive plan of how the “thing” can be evolved or suggesting some “alternative thing” which would be more suitable in your specific scenario.

As someone who has recently transitioned to people management, I’m acutely aware that before a manager can expect such Day 1 behaviour from the team members, it’s the manager’s responsibility to create the right environment and lead by example. So as a manager, Day 1 is Diving Deep into the anecdotes from your team when the anecdotes are telling you a different story than the “thing”. Day 1 is Earning Trust of your team every single day by listening attentively and treating everyone respectfully. Day 1 is seeking diverse perspectives which will help you to make the right decision about the “thing” - whether to keep it, tweak it or change it for something else. And if you have done all that - with empathy - only then would you reach the point where you can expect Day 1 mentality from your team, and occasionally ask them to Disagree, but Commit.
