# Hello

This is a space where I will write my reflections on my second attempt at people management. With the benefit of hindsight, I admit I failed miserably in my first attempt. My sincere apologies to the people who I micro-managed. Now that I'm a little bit older, hopefully wiser, this is my take two.
